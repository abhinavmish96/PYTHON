# Python uses boolean variables to evaluate conditions. The boolean values True and False are returned when an expression is compared or evaluated

# Notice that variable assignment is done using a single equals operator "=", whereas comparison between two variables is done using the double equals operator "==". The "not equals" operator is marked as "!=".

x = 2
print( x == 2)
print( x == 3)
print(x < 3)
