# Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

# A very basic class would look something like this:

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
